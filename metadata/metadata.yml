name: IEEE OJSP - Federated Learning with Automated Dual-Level Hyperparameter Tuning
  (FLAUTO)
description: FLAUTO is a federated learning method that performs automated hyperparameter
  tuning at both the server and client levels. It dynamically adjusts the global learning
  rate based on validation loss and locally tunes each client's batch size and number
  of epochs using model deviation metrics. This dual-level approach accelerates convergence,
  reduces communication and energy costs, and eliminates the need for manual hyperparameter
  initialization. FLAUTO is compatible with various optimizers and aggregation methods
  and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse datasets
  and settings.
