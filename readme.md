# FLAUTO üéºüé∂

## The Method

Method Name: FLAUTO üéºüé∂  
(Stands for [F]ederated [L]earning [AUTO]mated ‚Äî also "flauto" is the Italian word for ‚Äúflute.‚Äù)

Method Description:  
FLAUTO is a federated learning method that performs automated hyperparameter tuning at both the server and client levels. It dynamically adjusts the global learning rate based on validation loss and locally tunes each client‚Äôs batch size and number of epochs using model deviation metrics. This dual-level approach accelerates convergence, reduces communication and energy costs, and eliminates the need for manual hyperparameter initialization. FLAUTO is compatible with various optimizers and aggregation methods and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse datasets and settings.
